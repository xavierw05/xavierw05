# 🗂️ Portfolio
A collection of geospatial projects focused on identifying environmental and socio-economic disparities across different territories, in order to visualize how they reflect pertinent global issues. This portfolio includes maps and analytical diagrams created to document my GIS skills, experiment a variety of methods, and build a personal reference for future projects.
#### Overview
- [North America](#north-america)

## North America
North America, the third-largest continent, spans around 24.7 million square kilometers, encompassing Canada, the United States, and Mexico. It extends from the northern Arctic tundra to the southern tropical regions. This continent experiences prominent natural factors that coincide with its population's distribution. I chose to start with this region because of its environmental and demographic diversity, ranging from remote natural wilderness to densely populated urban metropolises.

### Biomes

I developed this map first to illustrate North America’s principal biomes using Level I Ecoregion data, providing environmental context for the continent’s natural phenomena and demographic patterns. Biome boundaries are displayed alongside national administrative divisions, including Canadian provinces, U.S. states, and Mexican *estados*. The continent encompasses a wide range of biomes. Firstly, the Arctic Cordillera and tundra dominate the far north, with cold, arid polar conditions, while Canada’s expansive boreal forests exist under subarctic climates. Secondly, the northeastern United States is characterized by eastern temperate forests, and the central Great Plains feature grasslands across semi-arid to temperate climatic zones. Thirdly, western regions include Pacific coastal forests with marine climates, mountainous northwestern forests spanning multiple elevations, and California’s Mediterranean zone. Lastly, the Southwest features hot, dry deserts, while southern Mexico hosts tropical wet-dry forests, temperate mountain ranges, and semi-arid plateau regions.

### United States

#### Wildfires

In this map, I visualized vegetation cover across the United States, highlighting the transition from dense eastern forests to herbaceous landscapes extending from North Dakota to eastern Texas. The Midwest exhibits comparatively lower vegetation density, while shrublands dominate much of the West and Alaska. By overlaying wildfire perimeter polygons, the map shows that forests in the eastern U.S. remain largely undisturbed, whereas the West Coast emerges as the primary area of concern, with numerous high-complexity (Type 1) fires. This pattern unexpectedly extends into Alaska, despite its much colder climate. Secondary areas of concern include the interior western states, particularly New Mexico, Arizona, Colorado, and Idaho, where moderate to high wildfire activity is also evident. Texas displays a distinct spatial pattern, as wildfire activity in the eastern part of the state is dominated by smaller low-complexity (Type 5) fires, while northern Texas contains a prominent Type 1 fire polygon.

       This visualization ranks the ten U.S. states with the highest tornado activity over the past two decades, highlighting notable geographic patterns in severe weather occurrence. Tornado events were first compiled using Microsoft Excel by summing all tornado occurrences for each state and ranking them accordingly. Texas emerges as a clear outlier with 2,334 recorded events, exceeding the second-ranked state, Kansas with 1,637 occurences, by a substantial margin. Notably, almost all of these states exceeded 1,000 recorded tornadoes during this period, justifying the broad spatial distribution of tornado activity across the Central and Southern United States.

    This dataset highlights the top ten U.S. states with the highest frequency of high-intensity tornadoes (EF3 - EF5). The rankings were generated by filtering tornado events in Microsoft Excel based on intensity. Kansas and Texas lead with 60 high-intensity occurences each, followed closely by Mississippi with 58. Arkansas also appears among the top ten with 27 events, despite not being among the states with the highest total tornado counts overall. States that rank highly for overall tornado activity, such as Illinois, Louisiana, and Florida, are absent from this high-intensity chart.
