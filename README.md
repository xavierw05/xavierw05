# 🗂️ Portfolio
A collection of my geospatial analyses and mapping projects, focusing on real-world challenges such as natural disasters, socio-demographic inequalities, and other spatial disparities across different regions worldwide, using data from a variety of governmental and organizational sources.
#### Overview
- [North America](#north-america)

## North America
North America, the third-largest continent, spans around 24.7 million square kilometers, encompassing Canada, the United States, and Mexico. It extends from the northern Arctic tundra to the southern tropical regions. This continent experiences prominent natural factors that coincide with its population's distribution. I chose to start with this region because of its environmental and demographic diversity, ranging from remote natural wilderness to densely populated urban metropolises.

### Biomes

I developed this map first to illustrate North America's principal biomes using Level I Ecoregion data, providing environmental context for the continent's natural systems and demographic patterns. The continent includes a wide range of biomes. Firstly, the Arctic Cordillera and tundra dominate the far north, with cold, arid polar conditions, while Canada's expansive boreal forests exist under subarctic climates. Secondly, the northeastern United States is characterized by eastern temperate forests, and the central Great Plains feature grasslands across semi-arid to temperate climatic zones. Thirdly, western regions include Pacific coastal forests with marine climates, mountainous northwestern forests spanning multiple elevations, and California's Mediterranean zone. Lqstly, the Southwest features hot, dry deserts, while southern Mexico hosts tropical wet-dry forests, temperate mountain ranges, and semi-arid plateau regions.
