I developed this map first to illustrate North America’s principal biomes using Level I Ecoregion data, providing environmental context for the continent’s natural phenomena and demographic patterns. Biome boundaries are displayed alongside national administrative divisions, including Canadian provinces, U.S. states, and Mexican *estados.* The continent encompasses a wide range of biomes. Firstly, the Arctic Cordillera and tundra dominate the far north, with cold, arid polar conditions, while Canada’s expansive boreal forests exist under subarctic climates. Secondly, the northeastern United States is characterized by eastern temperate forests, and the central Great Plains feature grasslands across semi-arid to temperate climatic zones. Thirdly, western regions include Pacific coastal forests with marine climates, mountainous northwestern forests spanning multiple elevations, and California’s Mediterranean zone. Lastly, the Southwest features hot, dry deserts, while southern Mexico hosts tropical wet-dry forests, temperate mountain ranges, and semi-arid plateau regions.

## Continental U.S. Tornadoes

I chose tornadoes as my next primary topic to analyze the spatial distribution of another major natural disaster in the United States, as it highlights the regions that are particularly vulnerable to severe weather. Tornado data were gathered from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), whose records date back to 1950, but the analysis was limited to 2004 - 2024 to reflect improvements in detection technology and reporting accuracy.

<br>
<p align="center">
    <img src="tor_pts.PNG" alt="Tornado points" width="600">
  <br>
    <em>Figure 3.a</em>
</p>

Tornado activity follows a distinct spatial pattern shaped by atmospheric circulation and topography. Hotspots develop where warm, moist air from the Gulf of Mexico interacts with cooler, drier air and strong wind shear, while activity declines sharply in the western United States due to mountainous terrain and less favorable atmospheric conditions. Tornado intensity is classified using the Enhanced Fujita (EF) scale, which ranks events from EF0 (weakest) to EF5 (strongest) based on estimated wind speeds and damage.
* Dense clustering in Oklahoma, Kansas, Nebraska, and southeastern states (Mississippi, Alabama)
* Minimal tornado presence in western states
* EF0 - EF1 events are most numerous, while stronger events are more dispersed
* Points cover roughly two-thirds of the continental U.S., primarily east of the Rocky Mountains

    <em>Figure 3.b</em>
</p>
This map highlights tornado movement across multiple states, showing both the typical southwest-to-northeast trajectory and variations. It was created by combining the initial and terminal points of each tornado based on their latitude and longitude. Incorporating EF levels along the full tornado tracks provides greater analytical insight than mapping them solely at the initial points, as it allows identification of regions that are more vulnerable to severe tornado impacts.
The tornado tracks show strong, consistent linearity, reflecting the steering influence of mid-latitude westerlies and cold fronts.
</p>

* Consistent influence of mid-latitude westerlies and cold fronts
* Southeast territories have higher concentration of long-track events
* Tracks sometimes form clusters, e.g., North Dakota - Minnesota and parts of the East Coast

    <img src="tor_dens.PNG" alt="Tornado Density" width="600">
  <br>
    <em>Figure 3.c</em>
</p>
I created this kernel density map using kernel density estimation (KDE), incorporating both tornado initial points and their tracks. The estimation was also weighted by each tornado’s EF level. This approach produces gradual transitions in tornado density and reveals a strong east–west contrast, with the highest concentrations across the central interior of the United States and much lower densities in the mountainous and coastal regions in the western states.
</p>

* Tornady activity core is centered in the central United States and gradually expands outward into the Southeast
* The Northeast, upper Midwest, and Florida exhibit generally low to moderate densities, with no persistent core activity
* Very low tornado density dominates much of the western United States, particularly across mountainous and coastal regions
* Small, localized clusters of low-level tornado density appear in parts of the western U.S.

    <em>Figure 3.d</em>
</p>
This diagram ranks the ten U.S. states with the highest tornado activity over the past two decades, highlighting notable geographic patterns in severe weather occurrence. Tornado events were compiled in Microsoft Excel by summing all occurrences for each state and ranking them accordingly. Texas emerges as a clear outlier with 2,334 recorded events, exceeding the second-ranked state, Kansas, with 1,637 occurrences by a substantial margin. Notably, almost all of these states recorded over 1,000 tornadoes during this period, illustrating the widespread distribution of tornado activity across the Central and Southern United States. Key highlights include:
</p>

* Texas recorded the highest total number of tornadoes (2,334 events)
* Kansas follows with 1,637 tornadoes
* States like Mississippi (1,367 events) and Alabama (1,360 events) rank in the top four, showing that significant tornado activity also occurs outside the traditional "Tornado Alley"
* Nine of the top ten states exceeded 1,000 tornadoes during this period, demonstrating the broad spatial distribution of severe weather

    <em>Figure 3.e</em>
</p>
This diagram interprets the distribution of only high-intensity tornadoes (EF3-EF5) across the United States, highlighting regional differences in severe tornado occurrence. State-level rankings were generated by filtering tornado event data in Microsoft Excel based on intensity and summing total events per state. Key observations include:
</p>

* Kansas and Texas recorded the highest number of high-intensity tornadoes, with 60 events each.
* Mississippi followed closely with 58 events.
* Arkansas appears among the top ten with 27 events, despite not ranking among the states with the highest overall tornado counts.
* Several states with high total tornado activity, including Illinois, Louisiana, and Florida, are absent from this high-intensity ranking.

    <em>Figure 3.f</em>
</p>
Tornado activity is dominated by low-intensity events, with EF0 and EF1 ratings accounting for the vast majority of occurrences. In contrast, EF2 and higher-intensity tornadoes are rare, highlighting the relative scarcity of the most severe storms in the overall dataset.

    <em>Figure 3.g</em>
</p>
Within high-intensity tornadoes, EF3 events dominate, while EF4 and EF5 occurrences are comparatively rare. This highlights that even among severe storms, the most extreme tornadoes are uncommon, making them critical points of study for risk assessment and mitigation.
