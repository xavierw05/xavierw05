# 🗂️ Portfolio
A collection of my geospatial analyses and mapping projects, focusing on real-world challenges such as natural disasters, socio-demographic inequalities, and other spatial disparities across different regions worldwide, using data from a variety of governmental and organizational sources.
#### Overview
- [North America](#north-america)

## North America
North America, the third-largest continent, spans around 24.7 million square kilometers, encompassing Canada, the United States, and Mexico. It extends from the northern Arctic tundra to the southern tropical regions. This continent experiences prominent natural factors that coincide with its population's distribution. I chose to start with this region because of its environmental and demographic diversity, ranging from remote natural wilderness to densely populated urban metropolises.

### Biomes

I developed this map first to illustrate North America’s principal biomes using Level I Ecoregion data, providing environmental context for the continent’s natural phenomena and demographic patterns. Biome boundaries are displayed alongside national administrative divisions, including Canadian provinces, U.S. states, and Mexican *estados*. The continent encompasses a wide range of biomes. Firstly, the Arctic Cordillera and tundra dominate the far north, with cold, arid polar conditions, while Canada’s expansive boreal forests exist under subarctic climates. Secondly, the northeastern United States is characterized by eastern temperate forests, and the central Great Plains feature grasslands across semi-arid to temperate climatic zones. Thirdly, western regions include Pacific coastal forests with marine climates, mountainous northwestern forests spanning multiple elevations, and California’s Mediterranean zone. Lastly, the Southwest features hot, dry deserts, while southern Mexico hosts tropical wet-dry forests, temperate mountain ranges, and semi-arid plateau regions.

### United States

#### Wildfires

In this map, I visualized vegetation cover across the United States, highlighting the transition from dense eastern forests to herbaceous landscapes extending from North Dakota to eastern Texas. The Midwest exhibits comparatively lower vegetation density, while shrublands dominate much of the West and Alaska. By overlaying wildfire perimeter polygons, the map shows that forests in the eastern U.S. remain largely undisturbed, whereas the West Coast emerges as the primary area of concern, with numerous high-complexity (Type 1) fires. This pattern unexpectedly extends into Alaska, despite its much colder climate. Secondary areas of concern include the interior western states, particularly New Mexico, Arizona, Colorado, and Idaho, where moderate to high wildfire activity is also evident. Texas displays a distinct spatial pattern, as wildfire activity in the eastern part of the state is dominated by smaller low-complexity (Type 5) fires, while northern Texas contains a prominent Type 1 fire polygon.

#### Tornadoes

</p>
This map visualizes tornado occurrences across the continental U.S. alongside population density, highlighting the correlation between meteorology and human geography. Tornado points are heavily concentrated in the Tornado Alley, roughly stretching northward from northern Texas to the Dakotas, and northeastward to Illinois. Furthermore, numerous tornado initial points also occur in the Dixie Alley, roughly spanning from Louisiana to Alabama. Tornadoes are also widely present in high-population areas, including eastern Texas, Tennessee, Alabama, and Georgia, emphasizing that major metropolitan territories are not immune to tornado hazards.
